# DoS-Analysis 

### Click [here](https://github.com/YashM8/DoS-Analysis/blob/main/README.md#instructions) for instructions.

## Brief Overview

Measures the width of the droplet at it's narrowest point. Automatically finds the desired linear part and finds it's slope after smoothing the data. For extremely low concentrations of most compounds used, there is also a tool to manually change the slope (if necessary) using a GUI.

## Measurement
`measure.py` gives the lowest measurement of the width in each frame. It checks each measurement to verify its accuracy before adding it to the dataset. The measurement is reliant on binarizing each frame and the threshold is automatically calculated from the points in the image.

## Finding the Slope
The data is smoothed using a custom function (in `analyze.py`) that connects the centers of each step to account for missing values that could affect the linear fit.

The `pwlf` library is used to fit a piecewise linear regression on the data and the appropriate slope is selected. Differential evolution is used to find the breakpoints for the data. More information can be found [here](https://jekel.me/piecewise_linear_fit_py/how_it_works.html).

Flagging bad data - Bad data is flagged automatically based on the sparsity of points in the last 20% of the data. The data is standardized before measuring for sparsity.

## Instructions 

1. Add the input parameters - 
   - Frames-per-second of the camera.
   - Needle width used.
   - Rows to skip, which is the number of rows that are skipped in each frame.
   - Show value. Set to `True` to show the video being processed and the plot with overlay.
   - Breaks, which are the number of breaks for the piecewise linear fit. The default is 6 segments.

2. Allow time to process the files. The progress will be displayed in the console. The number of files processed will be shown. And the number of files with bad data will be shown, typically files with very low concentration. You can identify bad data as folders starting with `0_FLAG_<File Name>`.

5. You will be asked if you'd like to verify the results. Once, you click yes, a GUI opens up.
   - Browse the directory of the processed files.
   - Iterate through the files through the GUI (`next` and `previous` buttons). The generated plots are shown.
   - If an overlay plot looks wrong, click `rework` and it loads the data.
   - Use left click for the start time and right click for the stop time.
   - Click `fit` to re-fit a slope to the data.
   - Click `save` to save changes to the generated output file (SLOPE_DATA.csv).
